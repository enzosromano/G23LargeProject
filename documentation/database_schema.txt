This file documents the internal schema of the MongoDB cluster we are using for this project.
For consistency, I will keep to the following structure when describing the collections and their contents:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"table_name"   (the internally used name)

-> description of table's general use/purpose

<data_type>   "field_name":   purpose and contents of field (extra qualifier) [attributes]
<data_type>   "field_name":   purpose and contents of field (extra qualifier) [attributes]
...
<data_type>   "field_name":   purpose and contents of field (extra qualifier) [attributes]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
